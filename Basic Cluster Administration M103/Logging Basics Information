ACCESS: Messages related to access control such as authentication.

COMMAND: Messages related to database commands.

CONTROL: Messages related to control activities, such as initialization.

FTDC: Messages related to the diagnostic data collection mechanism.

GEO: Messages related to the parsing geospatial shapes.

INDEX: Messages related to indexing operations.

NETWORK: Messages related to network activities, such as accepting connections.

QUERY: Messages related to queries, including query planner activities.

REPL: Messages related to replica sets, such as initial sync or hearbeats.(1) 

REPL_HB : Messages related to replica sets hearbeats.

ROLLBACK: Messages related to rollback operations.

SHARDING: Messages related to sharding operations.

STORAGE: Messages related to storage activities.

JOURNAL: Messages related to journaling activities. 

WRITE: Messages related to write operations, such as update commands.


(1) - What about heartbeats?
Heartbeat is the process that identifies the current status of a MongoDB node in a replica set. There, the replica set nodes send pings to each other every two seconds (hence the name).



Log verbosity levels.

-1: Inherit from parent
0:  Default verbosity, to include informational messages
1-5: Increases the verbosity level to include Debug Messages.

Log Message Severity levels

F: Fatal
E: Error
W: Warning
I: Informational(verbosity level 0)

Dissecting the log message. 


This is the structure for a message log:

Timestamp + Log severity level, verbosity level + Log Component + [connection]
command xxx.$xxx appName: "The client" + 

The entire skeleton was provided information about the command executed  + operation metadata (numYields: x reslen: xxx locks:{} protocol:op_msg 0ms)



Recap: 

MongoDB process log supports multiple components for controlling granularity of events captured.

You can retrieve the log from the mongo shell or using command line utilities like tail 

You can change the verbosity of any log component from the mongo shell.

Get the logging components:
mongo admin --host 192.168.103.100:27000 -u m103-admin -p m103-pass --eval '
  db.getLogComponents()
'
Change the logging level:

mongo admin --host 192.168.103.100:27000 -u m103-admin -p m103-pass --eval '
  db.setLogLevel(0, "index")
'

View the logs through the Mongo shell:

db.adminCommand({ "getLog": "global" })


View the logs through the command line:

tail -f /data/db/mongod.log

Update a document:


mongo admin --host 192.168.103.100:27000 -u m103-admin -p m103-pass --eval '
  db.products.update( { "sku" : 6902667 }, { $set : { "salePrice" : 39.99} } )
'


Look for instructions in the log file with grep:

grep -i 'update' /data/db/mongod.log
