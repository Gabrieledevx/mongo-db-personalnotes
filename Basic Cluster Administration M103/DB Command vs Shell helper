Theme: MongoDB Cluster

Target: DB Command vs Shell Helper


Database Command

db.runCommand(
   {
	"createIndexes": "<collection>",
	"indexes" : [
	{
	   key: {"product":1}
	},
	"name": "name_index"
	]

   }
)



Database command it's more large than shell helper


Shell helper provides a shortcut for methods.
Example:

We are following the same command in this case.

db.<collection>.createIndex({"product":1},{"name":"name_index"})

It's more quickly
