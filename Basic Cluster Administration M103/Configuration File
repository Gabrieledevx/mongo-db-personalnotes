However, mongodb use YAML format to specific this.

Launch mongod using default configuration:

mongod


Launch mongod with specified --dbpath and --logpath:

mongod --dbpath /data/db --logpath /data/log/mongod.log


Launch mongod and fork the process:

mongod --dbpath /data/db --logpath /data/log/mongod.log --fork



Launch mongod with many configuration options:

Note that all "ssl" options have been edited to use "tls" instead. As of MongoDB 4.2, options using "ssl" have been deprecated.

mongod --dbpath /data/db --logpath /data/log/mongod.log --fork --replSet "M103" --keyFile /data/keyfile --bind_ip "127.0.0.1,192.168.103.100" --tlsMode requireTLS --tlsCAFile "/etc/tls/TLSCA.pem" --tlsCertificateKeyFile "/etc/tls/tls.pem"


YAML

Example configuration file, with the same configuration options as above:

storage:
  dbPath: "/data/db"
systemLog:
  path: "/data/log/mongod.log"
  destination: "file"
replication:
  replSetName: M103
net:
  bindIp : "127.0.0.1,192.168.103.100"
tls:
  mode: "requireTLS"
  certificateKeyFile: "/etc/tls/tls.pem"
  CAFile: "/etc/tls/TLSCA.pem"
security:
  keyFile: "/data/keyfile"
processManagement:
  fork: true
