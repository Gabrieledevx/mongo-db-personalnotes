Theme: MongoDB Cluster

Target: The mongod (Mongo Daemon)

Mongod contains all configurations in the db. These are important to make our database secure, distributed and consist

In a cluster mongod must have running in each server. 

Mongod doesn't allow interact with this directly.
We need a client to interact with the database.
Note: Client need to be careful when running a command.


Commands: 

>Launch mongod in the first shell:

mongod

>Connect to the Mongo shell in the second shell:

mongo

>To create a new collection

db.createCollection("employees")


>Try to connect back to Mongo shell, without specifying a port:

use admin
db.shutdownServer()
exit
