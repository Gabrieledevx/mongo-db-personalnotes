Target: Reads and Writes on a Replica Set


Lecture Instructions

Note: In the video lecture, we used the old hostname "m103.mongodb.university" which has been changed to "m103" . We have updated all of the following commands accordingly.

Connecting to the replica set:



mongo --host "m103-example/m103:27011" -u "m103-admin" -p
"m103-pass" --authenticationDatabase "admin"
Checking replica set topology:



rs.isMaster()
Inserting one document into a new collection:



use newDB
db.new_collection.insert( { "student": "Matt Javaly", "grade": "A+" } )
Connecting directly to a secondary node (this node may not be a secondary in your replica set!):



mongo --host "m103:27012" -u "m103-admin" -p "m103-pass"
--authenticationDatabase "admin"
Attempting to execute a read command on a secondary node (this should fail):



show dbs
Enabling read commands on a secondary node:



rs.slaveOk()
Reading from a secondary node:



use newDB
db.new_collection.find()
Attempting to write data directly to a secondary node (this should fail, because we cannot write data directly to a secondary):



db.new_collection.insert( { "student": "Norberto Leite", "grade": "B+" } )
Shutting down the server (on both secondary nodes)



use admin
db.shutdownServer()
Connecting directly to the last healthy node in our set:



mongo --host "m103:27011" -u "m103-admin" -p "m103-pass"
--authenticationDatabase "admin"
Verifying that the last node stepped down to become a secondary when a majority of nodes in the set were not available:



rs.isMaster()
