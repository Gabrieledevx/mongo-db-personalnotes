>>Topic: Expressive Query Operator

Allows for more complex queries and for comparing fields within a document.
	The $ can be used to access the field value
	
	Syntax for comparison operators using aggregation:
	{ <operator>: {<field>,<value>}}
	
	
	
Example: 
Connect to the Atlas cluster:

mongo "mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/admin"

Switch to this database:

use sample_training

Find all documents where the trip started and ended at the same station:


db.trips.find({ "$expr": { "$eq": [ "$end station id", "$start station id"] }
              }).count()
              
              
Find all documents where the trip lasted longer than 1200 seconds, and started and ended at the same station:

db.trips.find({ "$expr": { "$and": [ { "$gt": [ "$tripduration", 1200 ]},
                         { "$eq": [ "$end station id", "$start station id" ]}
                       ]}}).count()
                       
                       
                       
db.companies.find({"$expr":{"$eq":["$permalink","$twitter_username"]}}).count()
