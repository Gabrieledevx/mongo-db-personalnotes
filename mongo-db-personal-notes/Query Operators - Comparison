>Find all documents where the tripduration was less than or equal to 70 seconds and the usertype was not Subscriber:

db.trips.find({ "tripduration": { "$lte" : 70 },

>Find all documents where the tripduration was less than or equal to 70 seconds and the usertype was Customer using a redundant equality operator:

db.trips.find({ "tripduration": { "$lte" : 70 },
                "usertype": { "$eq": "Customer" }}).pretty()
                
>Find all documents where the tripduration was less than or equal to 70 seconds and the usertype was Customer using the implicit equality operator:

db.trips.find({ "tripduration": { "$lte" : 70 },
                "usertype": "Customer" }).pretty()
