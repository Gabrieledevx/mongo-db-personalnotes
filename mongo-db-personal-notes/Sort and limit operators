>>>> SORT <<<<

If the query bar displays the Sort option, you can specify the sort order of the returned documents.

Set the Sort Order
To set the sort order:

1. In the Query Bar, click Options.

2. Enter the sort document into the Sort field.

	To specify ascending order for a field, set the field to 1 in the sort document.

	To specify descending order for a field, set the field and -1 in the sort documents.

As you type, the Find button is disabled and the Sort label turns red until a valid query is entered.


3. Click Find to run the query and view the updated results.


>>> LIMIT <<<

Note: Starting in MongoDB 5.0, the 
$limit pipeline aggregation has a 64-bit integer limit. Values passed to the pipeline which exceed this limit will return a invalid argument error.
 

Limits the number of documents passed to the next stage in the pipeline.

The $limit stage has the following prototype form:
	{ $limit: <positive 64-bit integer> }
	
$limit  takes a positive integer that specifies the maximum number of documents to pass along.


Using $limit with Sorted Results

If using the $limit stage with any of:
	>the $sort aggregation stage
	>the sort() method
	>the sort field to the findAndModify command or the findAndModify() shell method.

Be sure to include at least one field in your sort that contains unique values, before passing results to the $limit stage.

Example

db.article.aggregate([
   { $limit : 5 }
]);

This operation returns only the first 5 documents passed to it by the pipeline. 
$limit has no effect on the content of the documents it passes.


Note 2: 

When a $sort precedes a 
$limit

 and there are no intervening stages that modify the number of documents, the optimizer can coalesce the 
$limit

 into the $sort. This allows the $sort operation to only maintain the top n results as it progresses, where n is the specified limit, and ensures that MongoDB only needs to store n items in memory. This optimization still applies when allowDiskUse is true and the n items exceed the aggregation memory limit.
